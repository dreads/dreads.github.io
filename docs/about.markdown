Creating and learning are my passions. Viewing life as a journey, I created this blog to document my detours into various topics. 

> A man cannot understand the perfection and imperfection of his chosen art if he cannot see the value in other arts. Following rules only permits development up to a point in technique; to advance further the student and artist must learn and seek other knowledge.
&mdash;Miyamoto Musashi
